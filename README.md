## Abstract

This application is a web-service designed to connect dog owners. Members of the service have the ability view the profiles of other users on the site, and are able to schedule meet-ups/playdates with other members of their choice.

1. The landing page of the app is a dashboard view, from which a user can view all of their scheduled past and present (upcoming) playdates
2. From this same dashboard view, a user may choose to cancel/remove any playdates from their private profile page and/or search for potential new "matches", perusing through other profiles on the site for users who present as good fits for a doggie playdate
