## Abstract

Sniff is a service for dog owners looking to find friends for their lonely pups. Users have the ability to set up playdates with other users at a local dog park of their choosing. This application was built utilizing React, React Router, SCSS, ExpressJS, KnexJS, and PostgresQL.

## Snapshots of Application

1. The landing page of the app is a dashboard view, from which a user can view all of their scheduled past and present (upcoming) playdates
2. From this same dashboard view, a user may choose to cancel/remove any playdates from their private profile page and/or search for potential new "matches", perusing through other profiles on the site for users who present as good fits for a doggie playdate

## Wins

- Moving beyond MVP into extensions - e.g. implementing Google Maps API, writing 3 tables, adding DELETE functionality
- Building our first complete backend with Knex and PostgresQL

## Challenges

- Self-teaching Knex and PostgresQL in a day while building our first table-style database
- Resources for using Knex were very hard to come by so it was hard to find anyone to reach out to - we were mostly on our own with the documentation
- Troubleshooting some obscure Heroku-specific bugs related to SSL permissinos
